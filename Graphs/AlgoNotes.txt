* DIJKISTRAS ALGO -- shortest paths from src to all nodes -- Greedy based -- O(V + E.LogV)

* BELLMAN FORD --- shortest paths from src to all nodes(-ve edges) -- DP based -- (V.E)

* FLOYD WARSHALS ALGO --- or finding the shortest path between all the pairs of vertices -- O(V^3)

----
MST --- Minimum Weight Spanning Tree -- connects all the vertices with minimum cost edge with no cycle (edge weighted undirected graph) -- minimum possible total edge weight


* PRIMS ALGO --- to find MST -- same as BFS u need to use pq and add all their edges 

* KRUSKALS ALGO --- to find MST -- based on Disjoint Set(to detect cycle)

----
* FLOOD FILL --- graph traversal technique llly to DFS with conditions (in implicit graph) like rat in a maze

----
* TARJANS ALGO --- to find strongly connected components,articulation points,find bridge(edge)

* KOSARAJUS ALGO --- to find strongly connected components, ( 1.reverse DFS 2.reverse o/p  or 1.topoSort 2.Transpose graph 3.DFS)
